# NLSE
Animal Crossing: New Leaf Save Editor

Quick Update: If you want to edit your AC savegame, I recommend you to use [ACSE](https://github.com/Cuyler36/ACSE) instead.
This fork is no longer supported, and ACSE is (and will) be much better!

Edits savedata with the same functions as the [web-js editor](http://usuaris.tinet.cat/mark/acnl_editor/) and more.

This fork of NLSE support the garden_plus.dat, friend#.dat and the exhibition.dat from the WA update, and have more functions.

Can fix Checksums, and edit numerous things within the garden_plus.dat file.
